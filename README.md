# ⚠️ Warning

**This repository is unstable for general use and it will remain that way.**

- I am not a developer, nor a Linux pro.
- I do not know what I’m doing.
- If something breaks, it’s your problem — use with caution.

## 💻 My Setup

These dotfiles are tailored specifically for my main laptop.

**Hardware**

    Laptop – Asus ROG Strix G513RM

    CPU – AMD Ryzen 7 6800H

    GPU – NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile

    RAM – 32 GB

**Software**

    OS – EndeavourOS (Arch-based)

    WM – Hyprland

# Notes

    These configs are heavily customized and often in flux.

    You’ll likely need to adapt things if you're not on a similar setup.

    Hyprland-specific scripts, styling, and keybindings included. (Thank you JaKooLit, what a legend)

    Expect hardcoded paths, raw scripts, and a bit of chaos.

# If you are brave enough ( or expert enough )
## Getting Started

Want to try this rice? Here’s a quick idea of what to check or copy:

    ~/.config/hypr/ – Hyprland configs

    ~/.config/waybar/ – Status bar setup

    ~/.config/rofi/ – Launcher theming

    ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_aliases – Aliases, functions, etc.

    Custom scripts in ~/.config/hypr/scripts
    Custom scripts in https://github.com/TsankoTsankov/scripts (private)

🙃 Final Disclaimer

Use at your own risk.
Things break. And I break things.
