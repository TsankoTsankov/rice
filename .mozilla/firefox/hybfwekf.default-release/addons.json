If enabled, New Tab Override reads the feed of www.soeren-hentzschel.at to show you the latest news.\n\nSilent permissions.\n\nNew Tab Override requires additional permissions, but Firefox does not prompt requests for the following:\n\ncookies\n\nThe cookies permission is needed to prevent the loss of container information if the container tabs feature of Firefox is used.\n\nmenus\n\nThe menus permission is needed for providing an entry in the tools menu for accessing New Tab Override's settings.\n\nstorage\n\nThe storage permission is needed so that New Tab Override can store settings such as your new tab page.","weeklyDownloads":1365,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Sören Hentzschel","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/1351101/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187261.png?modified=1622132317","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187261.jpg?modified=1622132317","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":303},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187262.png?modified=1622132317","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187262.jpg?modified=1622132317","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":303},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187263.png?modified=1622132317","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187263.jpg?modified=1622132317","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":303},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187264.png?modified=1622132317","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187264.jpg?modified=1622132317","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":303},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187265.png?modified=1622132317","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187265.jpg?modified=1622132317","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":303},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187266.png?modified=1622132317","width":700,"height":398,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187266.jpg?modified=1622132317","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":303}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/agenedia/3?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.3876,"reviewCount":435,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/reviews/","updateDate":1741201223000}]}
